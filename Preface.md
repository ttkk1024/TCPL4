# The C++ Programming Language 


## Fourth Edition


## Bjane Stroustrup


### Preface

C++ feels like a new language.That is,I can express my ideas more clearly,more simpley,and more directly in C++11 than I could in C++98. Furthermore,the resulting programs are better checked by the compiler and run faster.


In this book,I aim for completeness.I describe every language feature and standard-library component that a professional programmers is likely to need.For each,I provide:

- Rationale: What kinds of problems is is designed to help solve? What priciples underlie  the design? What are the fundamental limitations?
- Specifications: what is its definition?The level of dtail is chosend for the expert programmer; the aspiring language lawyer can flollow the many references to the ISO standard.
- Examples: How can it be used well by itself and in combination with other features? What are the key techniques and idioms?


The use of C++ has changed dramatically over the years and so has the language itself.From the point of view of aprogrammer,most of the changes have been imporvements.The current ISO 
standard C++(ISO/IEC 14882-2011,usually called C++11) is simply a far better tool fro writing quality software than were previous versions. How its ti a better tool?What kinds of programming styles and techniques does modern C++ support? What language and standard-library features support those techniques? What are the basic building blocks of elegant,correct,maintainable,and efficient C++ code? Those are the key questions answered by this book.Many answers are not the same as you would find with 1985,1995,or 2005 vintage C++: progress happens.

C++ is a general-purpose programming language emphasizing the design and use of type-rhic lightweight abstractions. It is particularly suited for resource-constrained applicatons,such as those found in software infrastructures.C++ rewards the programmer who takes the time to master techniques for writing quality code. C++ is a language for someone who takes the task fo programming seriously. Our civlization depends critically on software; it had better be quality software.

There are billions of lines of C++ deployed.This pust a preminum on stability, so 1985 and 1995 C++ code still works and will continue to work for decadesã€‚ However, for call applications, you can do better with modern C++; if you stick to older styles, you will be writing lower-quality and worse-performing code. The emphasis on stability also implies that standards-conforming code you write today will still work a couple of decades from now. All code in this book condorms to the 2011 ISO C++ standard.

This book is aimed at three audiences:
- C++ programmers who wnat to kenow what the latest ISO C++ standard has to offer,
- C programmers who wonder what C++ provides beyond C, and
- People with a background in application lanugaes, such as Java, C#, Python, and Ruby, lokking for something "closer to the machine" - something more flexible,somthing offering better compile-time checking, or something offering better performance.

Naturally, these three groups are not disjont - a profressional software developer masters moare than just one programming language.

This bok assumes that its reader are programmers. If you ask, "What's a fro-llop?" or "What's a compiler?" then this book is not (yet) for you; instead, I recommend my Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++ to get started with programming and C++. Furthermore, i assume that readers have some maturity as software developers. If you ask "Why bother testing?"or say, "All languages are basically the ssame;just show me hte syntax" ore are confident that there is a single language that is ideal for every taks, this is not the book for you.

What features does C++11 offer over and above C++98? A machine model suitable for modern computers with lots of cocurrency. Language and standard-library facilities for doing systems-level concurrent programming (e.g; using multicores)
