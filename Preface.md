# The C++ Programming Language 


## Fourth Edition


## Bjane Stroustrup


### Preface

C++ feels like a new language.That is,I can express my ideas more clearly,more simpley,and more directly in C++11 than I could in C++98. Furthermore,the resulting programs are better checked by the compiler and run faster.

In this book,I aim for completeness.I describe every language feature and standard-library component that a professional programmers is likely to need.For each,I provide:

- Rationale: What kinds of problems is is designed to help solve? What priciples underlie  the design? What are the fundamental limitations?
- Specifications: what is its definition?The level of dtail is chosend for the expert programmer; the aspiring language lawyer can flollow the many references to the ISO standard.
- Examples: How can it be used well by itself and in combination with other features? What are the key techniques and idioms?
