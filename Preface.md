# The C++ Programming Language 


## Fourth Edition


## Bjane Stroustrup


### Preface

C++ feels like a new language.That is,I can express my ideas more clearly,more simpley,and more directly in C++11 than I could in C++98. Furthermore,the resulting programs are better checked by the compiler and run faster.

In this book,I aim for completeness.I describe every language feature and standard-library component that a professional programmers is likely to need.For each,I provide:

- Rationale: What kinds of problems is is designed to help solve? What priciples underlie  the design? What are the fundamental limitations?
- Specifications: what is its definition?The level of dtail is chosend for the expert programmer; the aspiring language lawyer can flollow the many references to the ISO standard.
- Examples: How can it be used well by itself and in combination with other features? What are the key techniques and idioms?


The use of C++ has changed dramatically over the years and so has the language itself.From the point of view of aprogrammer,most of the changes have been imporvements.The current ISO 
standard C++(ISO/IEC 14882-2011,usually called C++11) is simply a far better tool fro writing quality software than were previous versions. How its ti a better tool?What kinds of programming styles and techniques does modern C++ support? What language and standard-library features support those techniques? What are the basic building blocks of elegant,correct,maintainable,and efficient C++ code? Those are the key questions answered by this book.Many answers are not the same as you would find with 1985,1995,or 2005 vintage C++: progress happens.

C++ is a general-purpose programming language emphasizing the design and use of type-rhic lightweight abstractions. It is particularly suited for resource-constrained applicatons,such as those found in software infrastructures.C++ rewards the programmer who takes the time to master
